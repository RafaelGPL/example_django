# Django tutorial web app
This repository hosts the app we've worked on during previous classes.
Each branch in the repository will represent what we've done on class sessions.

## Installing
You should have a virtual environment somewhere on your machine that you'd like to use for this project
prior to setting it up.
In our case, our virtual environment was in the parent directory of wherever we had this project's folder or directory.

So in our case, from this folder we would run:
`source ../venv/bin/activate`

Now we want to install our python modules via pip3, so run:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Finally to run the project:
`python3 manage.py runserver`


Remember that to deactivate your virtual environment we'd just type:
`deactivate`
